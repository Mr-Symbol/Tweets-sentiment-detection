# Detection of depression indicative tweets

Depression is considered to be a major contributor to global disability and a major reason for suicide. Many affected individuals find it difficult to seek appropriate professional assistance due to the social stigma associated with mental disorders like depression and so, they turn to social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc., to share their feelings. 
The key objective of this study is the detection of depression-related posts in social media platforms. For this purpose, we use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning approaches to train text classification models on data collected from different social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter and analyse their performance  to select the best performing model.
This project presents an efficient model to detect the depressive tweets using modern natural language processing techniques. The tweets are collected using twitter api. Tweepy is used to acces twitter api. This project focuses on the combination of sentiment analysis, pretrained word vectors and modern deep learning techniques to get better results with respect to accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score.
